You’ll enter the URL and then choose a folder you want the files to go into. Make sure you pick your correct browser. Create or select the destination folder where you want the files to download to. 

 

Once you hit the ‘Download’ button, it will launch a pop up of your browser, make sure to let that do its thing. The window will close once it’s done downloading all the excel files on that page. Rinse and repeat as necessary!
If you’re all done you can close the small window and the program will shut down.
